Optimization Algorithm:

Develop a more sophisticated planning algorithm that prioritizes recipes utilizing similar leftover ingredients (e.g., if a recipe uses half a yogurt, find another recipe that uses the remaining half). This might involve a scoring system or constraint programming.

Consider using a graph-based approach or more complex data structures to manage ingredient availability.
